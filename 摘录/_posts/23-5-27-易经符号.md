The basic structure of the Five Arts is rooted in the rhythm of nature, Yi or Change. I Ching has become the iconic but not the only text of this timeless knowledge. 易 Yi covers all and everything in space and time. It is the inter-dependency, interaction, and inter-transmutation of Yin-Yang. Nothing is forever except change. Change has four aspects.
1. 理 Li - reason, logic, truth, meaning.
2. 氣 Qi / Chi - vitality, vital energy, creative flow, life force.
3. 象 Xiang - image, appearance, shape, form, 
4. 數 Shu - number, quantify, qualify, sequence.
