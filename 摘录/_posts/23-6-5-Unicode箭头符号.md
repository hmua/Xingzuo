After you go over a half dozen designs, you will be able to see which specific design brings out your intentions in the best way possible.
A Brief History of the Arrow Symbol
One of the first arrow symbols to ever be discovered was found in the greek city of Ephesus, which is now located in Turkey. This arrow was drawn way back in the 1st century AD. That specific arrow was used to indicate the road to a local drinking place which also served as a sort of brothel. The symbol was written next to a footprint, opposite a basic drawing of a woman’s face. The message basically said: “Walk in the direction that the foot is pointing towards to reach the brothel”. In a way, this was the earliest visual equivalent of the phrase “follow the footprints”. Although the symbol does not look like the modern day arrow we know today, it is still very clear to the eye, and is fairly straightforward.
The Modern Day Arrow Symbol
The earliest appearance of the modern day arrow symbol can be dated back to the 18th century. The earliest modern arrow symbol that was ever discovered was found in an illustration made by Bernard Forest de Bélidor, who was a French engineer, famous for his work in the hydraulics and ballistics fields. In the now famous illustration, made in 1737 by the way, you can visibly see an arrow symbol that was drawn to indicate the flow of water, and to demonstrate the rotation of a basic water wheel. Bélidor found a symbol to serve his needs to clarify to his workers where the water should enter the wheel.
After the discovery of the Bélidor illustration, numerous other papers were found with a version of the modern day arrow symbol drawn on them, often used to indicate the direction of rivers and water. According to researchers, the modern day arrow symbol was specifically used to indicate the direction of water for field workers.
A Deeper Meaning Behind the Arrow Symbol
In other societies, the arrow symbol has embraced a more abstract meaning behind its usage. For example, In Native American society, the symbol of an arrow serves as a sign for weapon, which leads to a second symbol, that of a broken arrow, which serves as a sign for peace. The logic conclusion is that you cannot fight a battle with a broken arrow.
Today, the arrow symbol has become one of the most recognized symbols in human society. It has shed most of the deeper meanings behind it and embraced a more basic function. No matter where you are in the world, the arrow symbol is almost always taken as a literal indicator for direction. Whether it's a straight arrow, curved arrow, bold or even a squiggle arrow, it will more often than not indicate a specific direction you need to take in order to reach your destination.
Commercial Use of the Arrow Symbol - How To Use It Successfully
In the modern era of commercial symbol design, various companies use the arrow symbol to build onto its universal recognition. Take the international mail shipping company FedEx for example, which added the arrow symbol to their logo, using it to their advantage when appealing to non-english speaking countries. The arrow symbol shows the direction of the mail, indicating that they are moving it forward.
But FedEx is not alone, Subway restaurants also use the arrow symbol to indicate their fast service. They are letting the customers know before they even walk into the restaurant that their service is quicker than that of their competitors. The arrow symbol signals that you will go in and out of the restaurant in just a few moments. That is everything you need to know even if you are not speaking english. Another famous example is the auto manufacturer Volvo, which incorporated the Roman symbol for Mars in its logo. The arrow is projecting outwards from an open circle. It also alluded to the sign of the chemical element iron, which gives the idea that their cars are stronger than those of other companies.
