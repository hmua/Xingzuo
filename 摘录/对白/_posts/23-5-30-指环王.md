>A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends, and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.

>An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight!
>
By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West!

## Oaths
>Fight for us, and regain your honor. What say you?
>
I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled! What say you!
>
You have my word! Fight, and I will release you from this living death! What say you?
