I have a Jekyll page in the master branch of a repository and used to have a GitHub workflow that transforms my Jekyll markdown website into static HTML in a `static` branch:

## .github/workflows/build.yml

```
name: Build and deploy Jekyll site to the static branch

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: vendor/bundle
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-gems-
      - uses: helaili/jekyll-action@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          target_branch: "static"
```

Then I set GitHub pages to the static HTML content of the `static` branch and it worked fine. However I noticed that I don't need that at all, as I can just remove the workflow, point GitHub pages to the `master` branch and it will directly publish it from the `master` branch in Markdown form using Jekyll.

Now I don't know which of those two approaches I should use. Is one faster or more flexible then the other? What are the tradeoffs between them? Will GitHub look at my Gemfile or Gemfile.lock or use it's own predefined Jekyll version? Can I use any Gems I want to use any document processor or is there some invisible filter which only allows certain Gems? Does GitHub transform the page to HTML once and publish it to a hidden branch or does it run Jekyll as a server?
